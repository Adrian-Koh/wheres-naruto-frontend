# Where's Naruto (Frontend)

Welcome to Where's Naruto, a twist on the original game of Where's Waldo. In this game, you'll identify a list of characters from the popular anime series. If your score is amongst the top 10 scores of the game, you'll be on the High Scores board!

You'll have to click on anywhere on the image to first see the list of characters to identify. On clicking a face, select from the list of characters on who they are and the game is completed on all characters being identified.

The game starts as soon as the page is loaded.

Have fun!
